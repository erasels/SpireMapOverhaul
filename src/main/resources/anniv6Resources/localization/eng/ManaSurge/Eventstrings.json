NL NL It looks dangerous, but what could be causing this much #pMana to gather in one area? You might get hurt, but there could be something #yvaluable to help you on your journey...",

      "As you enter the #b@storm@ you feel magical energy being @forced@ into you. You feel your skin #r@tearing@ but see an item sitting on a pedestal within your grasp. NL NL As you take this item and leave the #bstorm, your body feels like it is about to #rburst, however, this #p~magical~ #p~Relic~ might be worth every second of pain."
